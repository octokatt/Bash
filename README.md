# GitHub Notes Maker

This is intended to be a set of bash scripts to auto-generate markdown notes for the Jekyll package.


## Prerequisites

* Sublime Text 3: Right now, the file is set to automatically open in Sublime Text- this can be changed within the main file to your word processor of choice.
* Jekyll: This is not a hard pre-requisite, as the notes created can go straight into a GitHub repo to create a website, and away you go, but it's useful to note that Jekyll is the back-end
* Ubuntu: This is intended for Ubuntu -- while it may work on other systems, YMMV


## Installing

# Copy this project down to a folder like Dev/Bash
# Mark desired scripts with a command like: chmod 755
# Add the folder from step 1 to the $PATH

At this point, you should be able to use notes-maker.sh to create a markdown file.
The script will expect the title of the markdown as the first argument.


## Running the Tests

As of this version, the file creation is simple enough to test by creating a file.  

Once this gets a little more complex, I'll go into further detail


## Deployment

Basic plug-and-chug grabs from GitHub.  More detail will be forthcoming.


## Built With

* Bash
* Fish


## Versioning

This is currently on version 0.3 -- previous versions were unworkable.
Versions are incremented by day until a major milestone is hit.  Version 0.3 means this project has just started, and approximately three days have been spent fiddling with it.


## Contributing

Not quite yet, but standards will be released.
